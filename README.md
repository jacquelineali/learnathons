# Learnathons

This repo is for organizing NUACM's learnathons.

## What is a Learnathon?

A learnathon is a day long event where participants learn new technology and then apply what they have learned by making a thing. The day is broken up into two portions: the learning portion and the making portion. During the learning section, attendees will learn from upper class man and professionals who are versed in the technology being discussed. This section is followed by a lunch break. During the second (and longer) section, attendees break into groups to make something with the technology they have just learned about.

## Learning
The learning section of the day should consist of 2 to 3 hours of presentations. These presentations will cover the basics of the technology being covered. Ideally, each presentation would be about 20 to 30 minutes long and will focus on an atomic portion of the technology in question.

## Hacking
After the learning sessions have finished and lunch has been devoured, the attendees will break into small groups and work on small project with the technology that they have just learned. In all likelihood, the organizers may have to create some infrastructure for the attendees to use. For example, if the learnathon was about AJAX, then the organizers would have to create a server for the attendees to access with there application.
