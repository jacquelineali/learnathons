## Hacking
For the hacking portion of the day, people will break into groups and try to create a small website that uses data from a web server.
 
## Infrastructure
We will need a small web server that serves up JSON and static content.
We'll need to come up with a mildly interesting dataset for people to play with.
Either we want kids to run it on their local (which frustrating because they'll have to set it up) or put it on docean and then deal with the fact that they won't be able to serve their own static content.
